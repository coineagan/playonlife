I'm Sean Cunningham.

I live in Japan on a sub-tropical island in a small apartment surrounded by pit viper infested jungles.

There's an idea forming in the Easy-Bake Oven that is my brain that says life should be about play. Not all is play. The pain and tragedy we experience demands seriousness. But there's not much else that does.

Society is an improv comedy show directed by someone with no sense of humor. The new golden rule is not setting each other up for success, but hogging the spotlight and denying other people's attempts to take part. There are now winners in something that was never a competition whose only achievement is ensuring no one had any fun.

Play is kindness, understanding, and acceptance. Play is about setting each other up to flourish because that's what makes life better for everyone.

A humorless society denies these things. The result is not only unneeded suffering and the denial of people from taking part, it's ensuring there's nothing worth taking part in.

It's a lot of work to untangle the arbitrary rules and belief structures that exist in such a humorless world, and it will probably never find true success. But at least it's something to work towards.
